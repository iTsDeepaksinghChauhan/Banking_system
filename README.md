Basic Banking System for spark foundation (internship) 
My nane is DEEPAK SINGH and I'm a student interning at The Sparks Foundation in the batch #GRIPNOV21​ and I'm very pleased and and excited for having completed this first task. 
The task was to create a basic #Banking_System​ for the #Sparks_Foundation​ and I was able to do so. After completing this I made a few modifications like adding a login page and creating three users : customer, manager and cashier. 
The frontend has been achieved by : #HTML5​ and #CSS​
For backend I've used : #PHP​ and #JavaScript​
Database used includes : MySQL
I made an Basic Banking System dynamic web site which can transiction and also keep history of that.
